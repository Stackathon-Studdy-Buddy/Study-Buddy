# Study-Buddy

Study Buddy is an react native app that allows users to post and view study groups in their area. This app uses the  Google Maps API to allow users to see all meetups on a map, or they can choose to see a list view of meetings based on their proximity. We used react-native because we wanted to create a mobile app that could be used on both iOS and Android. We decided to challenge ourselves and learn how to use firebase services on the backend, utilizing hosting services for our express server and firebase functions. 

Study Buddy was built by Liana Chan and Celia Macrae, two software engineering students at Fullstack Academy. Study Buddy was inspired by all of the technical interview prep work that awaited us upon graduation of the Grace Hopper program. It provides a way for us to stay in contact with our classmates and coordinate meetups to prepare for technical interviews.
